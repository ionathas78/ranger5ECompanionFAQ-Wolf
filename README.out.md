# ranger5ECompanionFAQ-Wolf - Beastmaster Companion Cheat Sheet

> An HTML cheat sheet for a friend's 3rd level Beastmaster Ranger wolf companion in hir 5E D&D campaign

A friend of mine has trouble keeping up with hir 5E ranger's animal companion during a session: remembering and figuring out the rules around the companion and how it performs actions and attacks and takes attacks in combat. I wanted to help hir out, so I threw together a web page ze could open in hir browser during the session that contained all the rules info ze needed, in addition to a FAQ-style explanation of the rules and a specific statblock for hir companion at its current level. Finally, I used LocalStorage to make the basic combat stats form-fillable and persistent between sessions.


## User Story

```
AS A roleplayer
I WANT a cheatsheet
SO THAT I can find my companion's stats and rules quickly
```

```
GIVEN THAT I am using the OGL-licensed 5E ruleset
WHEN I look at the cheat sheet
THEN I want it to contain all the rules I may need to reference
WHEN I find a rule I want more information about
THEN I need a hyperlink to online reference materials expanding on the rule
WHEN I need a statistic for my companion, or how to figure it out
THEN I need to access it quickly, with a minimum of searching
WHEN I come up with the stats for my critter
THEN I want to store them so I don't have to do the work next time
```

## Getting Started
Not required. This project is a one-document webpage. All you have to do is open the file in your preferred web browser. When values change in the form controls, it uses your browser's LocalStorage to keep the values between sessions.


## Usage
To use the controls at the top of the page, you just have to click on them to cycle the numbers or enter text in the box. Once a value is entered in the Max HP box, the Current HP box's minimum and maximum values are bound by the Max HP's value.
To expand a section, click the + to the left of its heading. To collapse an expanded section, click the -.
